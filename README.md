This is a small implementation of mDNS (Multicast DNS) based service discovery in safe Rust, with a small set of dependencies. Some highlights:

- supports both the client (querier) and the server (responder) uses.
- supports macOS, Linux and Windows.
- works with both sync and async code.
- no dependency on any async runtimes.

## Approach

We are not using async/.await internally, instead we create a new thread to run a mDNS daemon.

The API interacts with the daemon via [`flume`](https://crates.io/crates/flume) channels that work easily with both sync and async code. For more details, please see the [documentation](https://docs.rs/mdns-sd).

## Compatibility and Limitations

This implementation is based on the following RFCs:
- mDNS:   [RFC 6762](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762)
- DNS-SD: [RFC 6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763)
- DNS:    [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035)

This is still beta software. We focus on the common use cases at hand. And we tested with some existing common tools (e.g. `Avahi` on Linux, `dns-sd` on MacOS, and `Bonjour` library on iOS) to verify the basic compatibility.

Currently this library has the following limitations:
- Only support IPv4, not IPv6.
- Only support multicast, no unicast send/recv.

## Minimum Rust version

Tested against Rust 1.60.0
