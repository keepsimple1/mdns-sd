# Version 0.10.1 (2023-12-2)

This is a bug fix release.

## Changes

* update flume to 0.11 (#152)
* bugfix: signal event key is possible to overlap with socket poll ids (#153)

# Version 0.10.0 (2023-11-28)

## Breaking changes

* `ServiceDaemon::shutdown()` return type changed from `Result<()>` to `Result<Receiver<DaemonStatus>>` (#149)

## Other changes

* Related to the breaking change, a client can receive `DaemonStatus` to be sure the daemon is shutdown.
* A new enum `DaemonStatus` and a new API `ServiceDaemon::status()` are introduced.
* Updated CI in GitHub Actions: replace `actions-rs` with `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`.

# Version 0.9.3

This is a bugfix release.

* apply interface selections when IP addresses change (#142)
* Remove un-necessary panic (#144)
* Always include subtype info if exists (#146)

p.s. Happy Halloween!

# Version 0.9.2

The release includes a bugfix, thanks to @Mornix !

* fix PTR expiration from preventing later service resolution (#140)
* updated doc comments for `DnsCache::add_or_update`.

# Version 0.9.1

There are no breaking changes.

*  support interface selection (#137)

Added two new methods for `ServiceDaemon`: `enable_interface` and `disable_interface`, and some refactoring.

# Version 0.9.0

* Ssupports IPv6 (#130) (Thanks to @izissise)
* ServiceInfo: support get_addresses_v4 (#132)
* bugfix: set address type correctly (#134)

This is a breaking change, including:

- Trait `AsIpv4Addrs` changes to `AsIpAddrs` to support both IPv4 and IPv6.
- `ServiceInfo::new()` uses the new `AsIpAddrs` trait.
- `ServiceInfo::get_addresses()` returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, while a new convenience method `get_addresses_v4` returns IPv4 only.

But in general, because the trait hides away details, the user code is likely keeping working without code changes.

Improvements:

* avoid redundant annoucement or query packets (#135)

# Version 0.8.1

* Remove env_logger in dev-dependencies and lower MSRV to 1.60.0. (#128)

# Version 0.8.0

No breaking changes in API. This release brings two potential user-visible changes:

* use UDP socket to signal the daemon for commands. (#125)

This change reduces CPU utilization of the daemon thread as well as its latency to
the user commands. Internally it uses local UDP sockets to signal the daemon.

* Added the link-local feature to if_addrs in Cargo.toml to enable link-local interfaces in Windows. (#126)

This change makes link-local interfaces visible to users in Windows where they didn't show up previously.

# Version 0.7.5

* Revert the changes in v0.7.4 and support link-local addrs alongside routable addrs. (#122)

# Version 0.7.4 (deprecated)

* Not to use link-local addrs if routable addrs exist (#117)

# Version 0.7.3

## Highlights

- Internal refactoring: always use DnsCache to resolve Servive Instances. When processing incoming packets,
we used to update the cache one record at a time and also build separate service info structs to resolve. Now we finish the cache updates first, and then resolve instances from the cache.

- Added env_logger for the examples code and enhanced the examples as well.

## What's Changed

* Support updating instances after they are resolved by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/104
* add optional "unregister" in example code by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/107
* Returns an error with logging for read_name invalid offset by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/109
* register example should keep running by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/110
* Refactoring DnsCache and how to resolve Service Instance by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/108
* add sanity check in reading a record data RDATA by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/111
* Enable logging for the examples by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/112
* register example: a simpler input for the service type by @keepsimple1 in https://github.com/keepsimple1/mdns-sd/pull/113


# Version 0.7.2

Highlights:

- Implemented `Display` trait for `TxtProperty`: print using
`key=value` format, where `value` is same as `.get_property_val_str()`.

- Implemented `Debug` trait for `TxtProperty`: print using
a struct format, where `value` prints as a string if it is UTF-8, or
prints as hex if it is not UTF-8.

# Version 0.7.1

Highlights:

- A bug fix: remove duplicated keys in TXT records received.

# Version 0.7.0

Breaking Changes:

- Allow non-standard max length for a service name. The check for
the length of a service name is moved to the daemon. If a service
name is too long, there will be an error log and an error event sent
to the monitors.

- `ServiceInfo.get_property_val()` returns `Option<Option<&[u8]>>`
instead of `Option<&str>`. Now a new `ServiceInfo.get_property_val_str()`
returns `Option<&str>`.

In other words, migrate to `get_property_val_str()` if you don't
want to worry about non-UTF8 values.

Highlights:

- Allow non-standard max length for a service name: A new method
`ServiceDaemon.set_service_name_len_max()` is added to support that.
Only use it when you really need to.
- Support non-UTF-8 value for TXT properties.
- Support `no value` for a TXT property, i.e. boolean keys.
- Added checks for ASCII keys in a TXT property.

# Version 0.6.1

Highlights:

- Fixs a bug: missing TXT records in received responses.

# Version 0.6.0

Breaking Changes:

- `ServiceInfo::new()` takes `IntoTxtProperties` trait instead of a
`HashMap` of properties. It is also backward-compatiable: the trait
is implemented for `HashMap` and `Option<HashMap>`.
- `ServiceInfo::get_properties()` returns `&TxtProperties` instead of
a `HashMap` of properties. It is also mostly backward-compatiable:
support `iter()`, `get()` methods.

Highlights:

- TXT properties' names are now case insensitive. And the original user input
order is kept.
- A new method `ServiceInfo::enable_addr_auto()`: automatically fill in IP
addresses for published services.
- Detect IP changes.
- A new `ServiceDaemon::monitor()` method to return a `Receiver` handle to
monitor the daemon events, such as IP changes.
