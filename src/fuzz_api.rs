//! Entry points for the fuzz targets under `fuzz/`.
//!
//! This module is not part of the public API. It exists because `dns_parser` is
//! private to the crate, and a fuzz target is a separate crate that could not
//! otherwise call it. Keeping thin wrappers here, rather than making that module
//! public, keeps the exposed surface small and deliberate. Targets that need to
//! reach further in (`dns_cache`, say) should add a wrapper here too.
