# mdns-parser

A DNS message parsing utility for mDNS service discovery. Originally it was just a file in the [`mdns-sd`](https://crates.io/crates/mdns-sd) crate, and now it is built into its own crate so that it can be used in other cases. Please note that the API is still experimental and might change in near future.
